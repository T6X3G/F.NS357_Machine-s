 Help Morty!

Listen Morty... I need your help, I've turned myself into a pickle again and this time I can't change back!

I need you to *BURRRP*....Morty, logon to my computer and find the last three secret ingredients to finish my pickle-reverse potion. The only problem is, I have no idea what the *BURRRRRRRRP*, password was! Help Morty, Help!
